My Bachelor’s degree is in Biophysics from Arizona State University. I currently and researching sex differential in sex chromosomes and helping develop a CURE (Course Based Undergraduate Research Experience) at ASU and researching student engagement within that class. My career goal is to become a bioinformatician in industry.\nI have been teaching for seven years. I ran a preschool class for one and have been teaching kids in how to read for five years. I have also been a TA for graduate level classes for two years. I enjoyed teaching because I have always enjoyed getting people excited about learning. I started teaching by becoming a tutor at a company and running a preschool class at their center. I then transferred to Kumon as a tutor where I worked there for four years teaching kids how to read.\nTeaching Statement Teaching Documentation Below is a list of courses that I have either a teaching assistant for and materials I have made for said courses.\nTeaching Assistant for Research Computing\nI was a TA twice for an online graduate course titled Computing for Research. The clas taught students command line and a bioinformatics pipline for genomic analysis. The course had 250 students. My goal was to answer students questions on Slack, hold 2-3 hours of Office Hours and attend weekly TA meetings.\nTeaching Material Insert office hour videos Teaching Assistant for Genomics Research Experience\nI was a TA for a online CURE titled Genomic Research Experience. The class taught students the coding language R as well as walked through through a research question involving identifying sex of cell lines through gene expression. THe course had 52 students. My goal was to answer students questions through Slack, hold 2 hours of Office Hours, attend additonal weekly 2 hours worth of meeting with the students, and attend weekly TA meetings, grade students assignments, and subsequently analyze student enagement with the course.\nTeaching Material Insert Progress report examples Areas of Interest Materials Demonstrating Student Learning Professional Developement Diversity Statement ","date":1698105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698105600,"objectID":"c22151519d8cf81a3fa31ce33b2c2556","permalink":"https://annikajorgensen.com/project/portfolio/","publishdate":"2023-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/portfolio/","section":"project","summary":"This is my teaching portfolio","tags":["Portfolio"],"title":"Teaching Portfolio","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; Thesis Thesis Unable to display PDF file.
