I research differential gene expression in The Sex Chromosome Lab and am helping develop a CURE (Course Based Undergraduate Research Experience) at ASU and researching student engagement within that class. My hobbies include reading, hiking and rock climbing. My career goal is to become a bioinformatician in industry.\nI have been teaching for seven years. I taught kids how to read for five years and have been a TA for graduate level classes for two years. I enjoy teaching because I love getting people excited about learning. I started teaching by becoming a tutor and running a preschool class at their center. I then transferred to Kumon as a tutor where I worked for four years teaching kids how to read.\nTeaching Philosophy My goal as a teacher is to foster a culture of failure and a love of learning amongst my students. I believe that by learning how to fail students will become more resilient, honest people and become better scientists over all. I want students to be willing to try again when they make mistakes and see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. I aim for this culture of failure to especially benefit underprivileged students, who typically have a harder time throughout their degree. I aim for these students to feel less alone when they are struggling academically and be more likely to reach out. To receive feedback on how well I am completing my goal, I offer a survey before, during and after the course for credit where the students talk about how they feel about failure personally and within the context of the course. This survey will give me feedback on my goal and allow me to adapt to the needs of the students during the course.\nI develop a culture of failure by having the students watch me fail when I am teaching. I record lecture style content about key concepts where I make mistakes and I explain how and why I make those mistakes. I model these behaviors because it is known from Dr. Kimberly Tanner’s 2013 article “Structure Matters: Twenty-One Teaching Strategies to Promote Student Engagement and Cultivate Classroom Equity” (see link above) that establishing classroom community norms cultivates inclusiveness and fairness. If I see students especially struggling or not submitting assignments or quizzes, I offer to schedule a meeting with them one-on-one to give them an opportunity to explain their struggles. I schedule these meetings because according to Dr. Tanner, mentioned previously, monitoring student participation and making sure that all students are participating helps increase classroom equity.\nI also give assessments in the style of content-based quizzes midweek and assignments at the end of the week. These assignments are meant to teach the students how to self-regulate and be resilient to failure. The quizzes have unlimited attempts and are given midweek with the goal of making sure that the students are up to date with key parts of the material before the assignment is due. It also gives the students feedback on what they are missing and gives them a chance to correct mistakes they made reinforcing the idea that failure is a part of rather than detraction from learning.\nThe assignment at the end of the week is a submission of code that they create and debug themselves. This assignment was created to teach students how to be resilient to failure by forcing them to fail and help themselves. The assignment also includes sections where they submit their accomplishments and their challenges. This section reinforces the idea that failure is a part of learning and gives me timely feedback as to where the students are struggling. I grade this part of the assignment twenty-four hours after submission to give students timely feedback. I offer resources and advice to students who mention specific struggles, also forty-eight hours after submission any common misconceptions about course content are addressed. These techniques are used to show the student that failure is not the end result of learning but merely a part of the process.\nTeaching Documentation Below is a list of courses that I have been a teaching assistant for and materials I have made for said courses.\nTeaching Assistant for Research Computing\nI was a TA twice for an ASU online course titled Computing for Research at ASU (BIO 439/539).
